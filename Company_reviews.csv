0,Flipdish,Niko Vassilis,2025-01-16T11:33:52.000Z,Keep Away,"Keep Away. Terrible company to deal with. No different than other cowboys. They are so good to you and on the case up until to the minute they sell you the product. Kiosk, epos, online ordering you name it. Once signed up support is nearly ZERO and out of UK as expectedYou will have to fight your way to get things done. All those promises about what they ll do for you is a big LIE.Whats worst is that when you realise they are rubbish and you want to leave They ll just stop communicating with you and leave you in the dark.If you are in touch with them and your sales person is Alex be wary and stop dealing with flipdish to save you the hassle. Grubber, EposNow, Kayana, Grubhub, Food hub and Flipdish are all the same with their selling techniques but offering no reliable product. Try finding a more decent one if you canUPDATE : I have waited 10 days after their reply to come here and inform everyone that This company is not only a nightmare to deal with but They are also big liars. As of today They still have not refunded me fully. Their salesman have messaged me right after my first review and said refund was not made due to internal technical issues and would be made straight away and I would have it in 5 working days. If you dont want to go through all this Just avoid flipdish and make sure You do your research well before getting any sort of deal or contract.",1

They have exceeded my expectations so far and have promptly completed everything that was required from them to ensure a smooth transition. Their services are cut above the rest and provide top class support to help their partners maximise orders and profits. Ted Moore and Jelena Davis have been exceptional with their support and guidance and nothing has been too big or too small for them. Flip dish is a very well organised organisation with systems in place to support Restaurant‚Äôs, takeaways and retail businesses. I can confidently expect a good job from them with their marketing services to increase direct orders. Their website is user friendly for the business as well as the customer and push notifications, loyalty offers etc are just a click of a button away. We can highly recommend Flip Dish to any progressive business looking to grow and create a brand.",5

For over two weeks, our kiosk has been non-functional, and the payment terminal frequently disconnects, despite stable internet speeds and exhaustive troubleshooting on our end.The customer service has been slow, unprofessional, and ineffective. They repeatedly provide generic advice and fail to address the core problems. Communication feels like talking in circles, with no clear resolution or accountability. As a business, this has caused significant disruption to our operations, loss of sales, and damage to our brand reputation.We expected better support and reliability from a company in this space.

The system itself is user-friendly, intuitive, and designed to streamline the customer ordering experience. The initial setup process was particularly noteworthy; it was smooth, efficient, and made all the difference in getting us up and running quickA special shoutout goes to Wajeeha, who played an instrumental role in this process. Her expertise and assistance were invaluable, making what can often be a complex setup feel seamlessly manageable.Wajeeha's positive attitude and proactive approach not only eased the tension often associated with technology changes but also instilled confidence in our decision to choose Flipdish.That said, despite its strengths, there are Itill several little areas where Flipdish could improve. For instance, while the interface is generally clear, some features lack a bit of polish and could benefit from additional guidance or simplification. Additionally, thereareminor bugs that occasionally disrupt the user experience, reminding me that we are still in the early stages of working with the system.Overall, Flipdish has the potential to be an outstanding platform with its solid foundation. With a few tweaks and updates addressing the small pain points, I believe it could elevate itself to a top-tier solution in the market. I look forward to seeing how they evolve and improve over time.

201,Flipdish,customer,2021-05-13T16:25:40.000Z,"Efficient, helpful and the perfect system for our business","Perfect from start to finish. First of all, the ease and efficiency with which they will get your business started up is top quality. The system is easy to use and perfect for what our business required.They set you up with a very professional website if you require, and their ordering system is very very simple to use. Their portal website is very straight to use as well.You retain a lot of control in terms of orders which was the most important aspect for our business. As a business which offers food normally requiring a decent amount of preparation time, during busy hours we needed a system which afforded enough flexibility so that our business can function correctly. Flipdish's system offers that flexibility.And hugely important, no hidden costs. There are plenty of truly terrible companies out there with virtually no interest in actually providing YOUR business with a service suited and tailored to your needs. They simply care about their own sales, their own profit and so on. This means most of them will include hidden charges and/or apply charges different to which had been agreed in any prior agreement. Flipdish could not be more straightforward with their flat fee percentage. This really is the way to go since having full visibility of the expected costs is so important for you to plan how to run your business. The percentage itself as well is not exorbitant in the slightest for the service being provided. Have had numerous issues with other companies in the past. These included issues such as hidden charges and the usual truly deplorable behaviour. But I had the misfortune of having undergoing a trial period with one of Flipdish's big competitors. I have had a website domain ""stolen"", have had constant hidden charges, virtually 0 sales for a laughably high weekly fee and non-existent customer support. It was also the mightiest of headaches to discontinue from... a trial period. You would not believe how difficult it is to remove your trademarked business logos and menus to disassociate yourself from this said business. Foodhub, I'm looking at you.Would highly recommend that you get into touch with Flipdish to at least see if it is a suitable match for your business. Just believe me and avoid the headaches from partnering up with other companies/competitors. Full thumbs up for Flipdish who knows what they are doing and are doing it well.",5

The venue does not open until 16.00 the mistaken time I put in so canceling with the venue is tight. If there is a way to cancel an order on the app then I could not find it.Further to the above the venue told me to contact Flipdish which I did even though it was a Sunday they got back to me within half an hour and sorted out a refund. Great customer service so I have upgraded Flipdish to 5 stars. I still think you should be able to cancel an order within the app.,5
